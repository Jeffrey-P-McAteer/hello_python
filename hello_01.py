# Instead they may be used by humans to
# tell other humans what the code is supposed to do!

# For example, the function input() below asks
# the user to type some text in and it returns the
# text the user typed in.
# We can re-use that text by saving it to the
# variable users_name.
# Finally, the print() function sends data to the computer screen.

users_name = input("Hello! What is your name? ")

print("Hello "+users_name+", I am a computer!")
